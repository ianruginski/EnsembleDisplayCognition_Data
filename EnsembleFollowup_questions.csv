"7","R_2uEsIES6CZx6Me4","To decide which rig would receive more damage, I first looked at how close they were to the majority of the lines in the hurricane forecast. I thought that the closer one would be more likely to receive more damage, but I also looked at the other lines that were less concentrated on the outside to see if any went directly over the rigs. If one rig was very close to the majority of the lines then I said that they would receive more damage, but if the rigs were further away, I would choose the one that had lines running directly over it or nearby. Overall I used the concentration of lines and how close the rigs were to the lines to make my decision.",2,2,"The possible paths that the hurricane could take.",3,2,2,"Ensemble"
"8","R_2Cjnhq7VXRKQdjh","I chose the points that seemed to be most directly located to wind pattens and wind lines. If a blue line or visualization was closer or even passed through the given point, I chose that point because it seemed most likely to be affected by the hurricane.

"9","R_2fCfRORJI845WSH","I made my decisions on which oil rig would most likely be affected by seeing how close it appeared to the eye of the hurricane, or if it appeared to be located in an area high in possible jet streams based on the appearance of such, marked by the darker lines.",2,2,"Possible jet streams  protruding from what appeared to be the eye of the hurricane.",1,3,2,"Ensemble"

"16","R_wKKNutGrS2ZJ10B","At first I was very confused because I have no experience with hurricane mapping and did not know what these visuals represented. I decided that the lines in the maps deli the where the hurricane was going to hit and chose the oil rig that was crossing a line, or if they both were the oil rig that had the most lines crossing through it.

"17","R_294wK1jHegkacUv","On the maps where there were many lines on or near a oil rig, and a large empty area on the other, I assumed there was some sort of natural interference that cased the hurricanes to hit the other rig less. otherwise, I looked at overall hurricane paths, and guessed a quick probability of which would be hit harder.",2,2,"past huricane trajectory",1,3,2,"Ensemble"

"20","R_a9Lr2b4wPi8YWWZ","I just assumed that the rig that was closest to the main storm area would sustain the most damage, so I chose the rig that seemed to be the closer of the two. I also looked to see what the storm's projected course was (I interpreted the images as hurricane's and their estimated paths) and I tried to see if it seemed that the storm was going to spin into one of the rigs or one was in the direct path...",2,2,"the gusts(?) of wind",1,3,2,"Ensemble"
